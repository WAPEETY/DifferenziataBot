# DifferenziataBot
A bot that reminds you every day at 8pm to go throw the trash and especially what you have to throw

How I can configure it?

configure the bot is very easy, you only have to start the bot, send command /configura,
choose your zone (Urbana, Extra Urbana, Industiale), choose your type of collection (tipo domestico, non domestico)
and you've done, the bot will send you the message every day at 8:00 PM.

If I make an errore while I'm configuring the bot?

Don't worry you can use the command /cancella to reset your configuration.

What about other commands?

there are two commands /aiuto and /dona, the first is to get an explanation of the commands, the second is to make a donation to me
